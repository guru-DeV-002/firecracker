# A Stateful Guitar Processor

This is a virtual guitar processor that I built in order to get familiar with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/). Read the full story on [Medium](https://medium.com/@thedrumsknight/developing-a-guitar-processor-666c19c239d3#.22wftwfo9).

### Setup the project locally

Clone the repo and run `npm install` to install the dependencies. You might need to give `sudo` access to install the packages.

Run `npm run watch` and `npm run start` simultaneously in your terminal to start the project and go to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/) to see it in action.
